# Norby

Norby is a small but robust web framework. It's a Rack app, built to be very easy, small, and robust. The name came from the fictional robot Norby, which Janet and Isaac Asimov used to write short stories about. It's a small robot that can handle tough tasks, not just that, it's a very cute robot!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'norby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
